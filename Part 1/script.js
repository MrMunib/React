// Facebook k aik engineer ny bnaya 2013 mei and 2015 mei isy open source keya gya



// There is some like virtual DOM in React




// What is REAL DOM ?
/*
When we update a particular element in real dom all of the other elements are repainted and re-render. This is called re-render. (This is a long and in-efficient process)






Jb website pr bht sary changes hoty hain to bht sary elements repaints hoty hain including those jo badle bhi nhi hoty yani k jo required b nhi hoty to be repainted, aur ye website ko slow down krdeta hai, is cheez se bhi bachne k liye facebook ny react creation ki. (Notfications likes comments etc {agr sb kuch reload pr ho to website kr jay ge})










// Now what is Virtual DOM ?


Virtual dom --- real dom ka exact duplicate copy hota hei. Ismy jo b particular elem ko hm change krein gy to sirf whi hoge baki sb elements ko koif frq nhi pry ga . only usi part ko re-paint yar re-render kiya jata hai jo ki krna required hota hei
